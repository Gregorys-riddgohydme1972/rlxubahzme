Whoa. Just stumbled out of Warfare like I tripped into a dream. My legs cramped up from the tiny seats and the popcorn everywhere – who even cleans these places?? Okay, not the point.

> That opening scene, with the helicopters slicing through the sky like angry butter knives. My heart was pounding harder than when I forget to mute my Zoom mic at work. I mean, they don’t pull their punches, do they? The noise, the chaos... You'd think it’s still ringing in my ears, but honestly, I can’t tell if it's the movie or that kid behind me slurping soda like it’s the last one on Earth.

The plot twisted around more than the time I tried to untangle my headphone wires. Seriously, it’s all in knots, but somehow it just... works? Like, the betrayal felt heavy, like a backpack full of bricks. I could feel it in my chest, or maybe that’s just my back hurting from sitting like a pretzel.

> Did you know Danny asked about downloading the movie? Tell him he’s crazy – it needs to be felt on the big screen... or maybe not felt but survived. Definitely more intense than my usual IKEA assembly instructions. The explosions were like my DIY skills – all over the place and kinda dangerous.

There was this moment – you know when everything slows down? Like the world hits pause and you can see the sweat glistening and every grain of sand just hovering. It was beautiful, kind of like when you find that one smooth stone at the beach and can't stop staring at it, you know?

Oh, and that character, the one with the scar, had this look like a storm rolling in. Brooding and unpredictable. Just like my cat when he sees a bird, laser-focused and almost scary. Man, now I’m hungry. Might get pizza or something. By the way, if you watch the movie, be ready – it feels like a punch to the gut sometimes, but a good kind of punch? If that’s a thing? I dunno.
